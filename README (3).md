## Introduction

Air pollution is a pressing global concern with direct impacts on health and the environment. Predicting air quality levels enables better planning and response to pollution events. This project explores multiple ML algorithms to forecast Air Quality Index (AQI) using real-world data.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Insert dataset source or URL]
- **Attributes**: Includes concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Target**: Air Quality Index (AQI) level.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R²
- Visualizations for analysis and interpretation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Modeling Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, encoding
3. **Model Training**: Tried various regression models
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
5. **Evaluation & Visualization**

## Results

- Best-performing model: [e.g., Random Forest with R² = 0.89]
- Key factors influencing AQI identified
- Graphical insights into model predictions vs actual values
